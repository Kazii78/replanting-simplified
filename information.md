# Replanting Simplified
Harvest and replant crops by simply right-clicking them.

## Features
- **Right-Clickable Crops**\
Right-clicking crops will harvest and replant them. The items dropped from the harvest will be automatically put inside of the harvesters's inventory.
- **Radius-Increasing Hoes**\
Harvesting a single crop using a hoe will harvest a three by three area around that crap. It will only use up one durability for the entire area.
- **Bone Meal, Harvest & Replant Loop**\
Holding right-click on a crop will make it grow, then switch to harvesting and at last replant it. This can be kept going in a loop.
